# Getting Started with Create React App

## Environment Variables

- Create a .env file in the root directory and add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of NAME=VALUE. For example:
- The .env file should be gitignored. A .env.example file is provided for reference.

## Backend API Services

- Make sure you have your backend API ready on your local by referring to this [Task App API Services](https://github.com/xen-HendryZheng/task-application-node-react/tree/main/backend)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
